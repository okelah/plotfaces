home=Home
useSeriesColor_notes=Only supported on Y-axes in jqPlot, has no effect on X-axes.
show_notes=The first X and Y axes are always shown regardless of this settings. This setting can not be set to null.
autoScale_notes=This should generally be set to false (the default). The option has been deprecated in jqPlot in favour of the default scaler which produces superior results. If set to true both min and max must be null for it to have any effect. Possibly of some use when filling to zero or if a fixed number of ticks (numberTicks) is required. Doesn't appear to work with the tick interval (tickInterval) option.
minimum_notes=Sets the lower value for the axis. jqPlot will act sensibly even if the value is not sensible. For example if minimum is greater than maximum and both are set the chart will be plotted backwards (high to low). If minimum is greater than the maximum value and maximum isn't set the chart will run from the maximum value to the given minimum.
maximum_notes=See minimum
refresh=Refresh
padding_notes=The amount of padding to apply. This is calculated from the data range. The default should be 1.2 but it doesn't seem to be working correctly. Overridden by minimum and maximum padding.
paddingMinimum_notes=The amount of padding to apply to the lower end of the axis. This is calculated from the data range.
paddingMaximum_notes=The amount of padding to apply to the upper end of the axis. This is calculated from the data range.
borderColor_notes=Sets the color of the axis border.
borderWidth_notes=Sets the width (thickness) of the border in pixels.
labelText_notes=The label to display.
labelDisplay_notes=Whether to display the label for this axis. Defaults to true.
tickDisplay_notes=Whether ticks are displayed on this axis.
tickCount_notes=The number of tick marks to display on this axis.
tickInterval_notes=The interval between ticks. Requires an axis minimum (min) to be set. If the axis maximum is set it must be a multiple of the tick interval plus the minimum value or there are rendering issues.
tickSpacing_notes=No apparent effect (on line charts at least).
tickMarks_notes=Whether to display the tick marks. This setting is unlikley to have any effect since it is overridden by the mark setting of the tick renderer which defaults to true. To switch off tick marks something like this would be required in the axis: tickOptions: { mark:false }
minorTicks_notes=Whether to display minor tick marks. The default axis renderer doesn't support minor tick marks so this typically won't have any effect.
syncTicks_notes=Whether ticks should line up across multiple axes. Doesn't appear to have any effect at the moment.
showGridline_tick_notes=Whether grid lines are shown for this axis.
showMark_tick_notes=Whether tick marks are shown for this axis.
mark_tick_notes=Where tick marks are shown on this axis. This is an enumerated type. Grid lines need to be off for most options to have any visible effect.
mark_tick=Mark
showMark_tick=Show Mark
showGridline_tick=Show Gridline
isMinorTick_tick=Is Minor Tick
isMinorTick_tick_notes=Indicates that this axis provides minor ticks which prevents grid lines from being drawn. Setting this to true and showMinorTicks to false on the parent axis causes an exception.
yes=Yes
no=No
axisTickRenderer=Axis Tick Renderer
size_tick=Tick Size
size_tick_notes=Deprecated in jpPlot, use markSize instead. Has no noticable effect.
markSize_tick=Mark Size
markSize_tick_notes=Sets the size of the tick marks in pixels.
showTicks_tick=Show Ticks
showTicks_tick_notes=Single varaible for turning ticks (grid lines, labels and marks) on and off for this axis. Recommended to use showLabel and showMark instead.
showLabel_tick=Show Label
showLabel_tick_notes=Whether to show the tick labels.
prefix_tick=Tick Prefix
prefix_tick_notes=A prefix for the tick.
formatString_tick=Format String
formatString_tick_notes=The format to use for tick labels. The default formatter has syntax close, if not identical, to sprintf.
fontFamily_tick=Font Family
fontFamily_tick_notes=The font family to use for drawing tick labels.
fontSize_tick_notes=Size of the font for tick labels. Supports %, px, pt an em.
fontSize_tick=Font Size
textColor_tick=Text Color
textColor_tick_notes=Text color for the tick labels.
escapeHTML_tick_notes=Whether to escape HTML entities in the tick label.
escapeHTML_tick=Escape HTML
canvasAxisTickRenderer=Canvas Axis Tick Renderer
labelPosition_tick_notes=Position of the labels. This is an enumerated type. It doesn't apper to have any effect (at least under Chrome).
labelPosition_tick=Label Position
angle_tick_notes=The angle to draw the tick labels at.
angle_tick=Angle
fontWeight_tick_notes=The weight of the tick label font. May or may not be supported natively on the target browser (try setting enableFontSupport to false if required).
fontWeight_tick=Font Weight
fontStretch_tick_notes=The amount to stretch the text by. May or may not be supported natively on the target browser (try setting enableFontSupport to false if required).
fontStretch_tick=Font Stretch
enableFontSupport_tick_notes=Whether native font support should be enabled. The level of support for font manipulation varies widely and turning this off may provide more features. For example fontStretch is not supported under Chrome natively but can be used if this is turned off.
enableFontSupport_tick=Enable Font Support
pt2px_tick_notes=A scaling factor to use when converting from points to pixels.
pt2px_tick=Point to Pixel Scaling Factor
