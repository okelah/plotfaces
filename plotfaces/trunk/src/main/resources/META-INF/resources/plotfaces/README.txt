The jqPlot JavaScript resources are merged and minified using Google Closure
Compiler.

Note to self... there is a copy of Closure Compile on the Desktop along with a
script for compiling all the jqPlot libraries. Remember the jqPlot main library
must be the first item in the list of resources compressed / merged together!
Don't specify the files in alphabetical order.
